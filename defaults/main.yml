# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with groups to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible win_domain_group module.
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_domain_group_module.html

# Example:
#
# win_domain_groups:
#   - name: my_group
#     scope: global
#     category: security
#     path: OU=test_groups,DC=mydomain,DC=local
#     attributes:
#       mail: my_group@my-domain.local
#       wWWHomePage: www.my-domain.local
#     ignore_protection: yes
#     state: present

win_domain_groups: []

# Dictionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `win_domain_groups` variable. The members of the dict are the same
# attributes that the ones expected by the ansible win_domain_group module

win_domain_groups_defaults: []

# Indicate `win_domain_groups` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host
# variable that begins with "win_domain_groups_*" and contains the necessary
# attributes will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must
# follow the structure detailed before for `win_domain_groups`

win_domain_groups_load_from_hostvars: no
